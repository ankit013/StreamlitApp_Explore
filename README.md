# StreamLit Demo

## Welcome to StreamLit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.

To use it, just pip install streamlit, then import it, write a couple lines of code, and run your script with streamlit run [filename]. Streamlit watches for changes on each save and updates the app live while you’re coding. Code runs from top to bottom, always from a clean state, and with no need for callbacks. It’s a simple and powerful app model that lets you build rich UIs incredibly quickly. To learn more about how Streamlit works, see Main concepts.
